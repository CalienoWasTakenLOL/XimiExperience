## Basic informations
- **ROM Name:**  _XimiExperience_
- **Version:** 0.1 A
- **Release Date:** COMING SOON
- **Based on:** Stock rom (2015 kernel)

## **Description**
[based on Android 4.4.2]
Due to my dissatisfaction with the [_**MIUI 7 PORT**_](https://www.androidiani.com/forum/modding-smartphone-altroconsumo/522845-miui-7-deco77x-port-bigboss97.html) on _Deco 77x_, i decided to make my own "miui-inspired" custom rom, 
using the [_**Stock + clockwork PHILZ**_](https://www.needrom.com/download/deco-77x-2/) as a base and deleting some more apps later via root

## **Key Features**
- degoogled
- no malware
- no unnecessary apps
- ximi launcher 😍
- no cringe boot animation

## **Installation Instructions**
**UNPLUG YOUR PHONE AND REMOVE THE BATTERY**
1. install _SP FLASH TOOL_
>[windows](https://mega.nz/#!qApRBK6T!stKi3xa-zy-_1eeegvG_q1fiJqqUYbaOQp95Z-JxOck)
>[linux](https://mega.nz/#!WdonADiC!sCYrBBjy20WBdhps4IYjnRGHOiNk_shfsG2UB1RDoPQ)
>no mac :,)
>[4pda (russian)](http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=469340)
> alternatively you can find it on google

2. install [Preloader drivers](https://mega.nz/file/uQo1XDDI#EF0V4Tr5LgQvXuPAOSrcegtByZqrZt0tGtZe_8RZLms)
>this mega also contains ADB mediatek drivers

3. unzip the rom

4. select the scatter file

5. select _**DOWNLOAD ONLY**_ mode if your phone is fully working
   if the phone is bricked or unstable, selct _**FIRMWARE UPDATE**_
   **NEVER** select _**FORMAT ALL + DOWNLOAD**_ because IMEIs are lost, and a factory reset is not guaranteed
   * uncheck "_recovery_" if a custom recovery is already installed (to install a custom recovery,  click on the recovery path and select Philz recovery from the unzipped rom)
   * uncheck "_USRDATA_" for dirty flash (unstable)
6. click on  _**DOWNLOAD**_
7. _**WHILE HOLDING VOL UP AND DOWN**_ plug the phone (without the battery) to the computer, SP FLASH TOOL should start flashing
8. once you see a green tick, plug the battery into the phone and reboot

8.5. (optional) flash superSU via recovery
**GAPPS ARE UNTESTED** (and also useless on android 4.4.2)
