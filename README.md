## Basic informations
- **ROM Name:**  _XimiExperience_
- **Version:** 1.0 STABLE
- **Based on:** Stock rom (2015 kernel)

## **Description**
[based on Android 4.4.2] <br>
Due to my dissatisfaction with the [_**MIUI 7 PORT**_](https://www.androidiani.com/forum/modding-smartphone-altroconsumo/522845-miui-7-deco77x-port-bigboss97.html) on _Deco 77x_, i decided to make my own "miui-inspired" custom rom, 
using the [_**Stock + clockwork PHILZ**_](https://www.needrom.com/download/deco-77x-2/) as a base and deleting some more apps later via root

## **Key Features**
- degoogled
- no malware
- no unnecessary apps
- ximi launcher üòç
- no cringe boot animation
- performance tweaks
- already rooted (superSU)

## **Installation Instructions**
* due to some technical changes, the rom is now recovery-only, therefore, the flashing method has changed completely
* the phone MUST HAVE a recovery already installed (preferrably Philz)

1. Boot into recovery
2. wipe
3. flash zip
4. reboot
5. enjoy <br>
**GAPPS ARE UNTESTED** (and also useless on android 4.4.2)
-NOTE: Xiaomi's launcher auto installs some bloatware apps, I can't prevent it right now, but luckly they can easly be deleted just like any other app

## TWEAKS:
- set animations to 0.5 for a boost in performance
- download Wallpapers.zip for custom XimiExperience wallpapers


## **Known Issues**
- no app market yet (Aurora doesn't support android 4.4.2)
- unpreventable bloatware because of the launcher (can be deleted just like normal apps)
- you tell me
