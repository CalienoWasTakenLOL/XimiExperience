# XimiExperience
Originally created only for the Deco77x, XimiExperience is a custom rom that aims to bring the look and feel of old-school MIUI onto various devices I own, this is a hobby project created purely for fun, there's no guarantee I'll maintain it forever, this project was born due to my dissatisfaction with the MIUI 7 custom rom that was already developed for the Deco77x, and then branched into a complete project as time went on.

## FUTURE PLANS
